For the Techvisory webpage, adding a sixth service category titled "Tech Consultancy" will enhance the range of services provided. Here's how we could describe it and a visual idea to include in the image:

### Additional Webpage Content:

6. **Tech Consultancy:**
   - Expert advice to optimize technology strategy and innovation.
   - Custom consultations for IT governance, cybersecurity, and technology audits.

### Image Idea:

For the collage, we could add an icon that represents "Tech Consultancy," such as a consultant's desk with a computer showing graphs and charts, symbolizing strategy and analysis. This icon would complement the existing visuals and emphasize the advisory aspect of the service.

Would you like me to update the collage image to include this additional service?

### Image Idea:

The image for this section could be a collage showcasing the different aspects of tech advisory services offered by Techvisory. It might include icons or abstract representations for each service, like gears for Tech Development, a shield for Digital Legacy, a rising graph for IEO Consulting, a globe with exchange markers for Exchange Listing, and a network diagram for Corporate Tech Setup.

Would you like me to generate such an image, or is there something specific you want to adjust or add?
